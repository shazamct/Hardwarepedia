    <p>The AMD Jaguar Family 16h is a low-power microarchitecture designed by AMD. It is used in APUs succeeding the Bobcat Family microarchitecture in 2013 and being succeeded by AMD's Puma architecture in 2014. It is two-way superscalar and capable of out-of-order execution. It is used in AMD's Semi-Custom Business Unit as a design for custom processors and is used by AMD in four product families: Kabini aimed at notebooks and mini PCs, Temash aimed at tablets, Kyoto aimed at micro-servers, and the G-Series aimed at embedded applications. Both the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One use chips based on the Jaguar microarchitecture, with more powerful GPUs than AMD sells in its own commercially available Jaguar APUs.[2]

    <h3><b>Design</b></h3>
    <ul>
  <li>    32 KiB instruction + 32 KiB data L1 cache per core, L1 cache includes parity error detection
  <li>16-way, 1â€“2 MiB unified L2 cache shared by two or four cores, L2 cache is protected from errors by the use of error correcting code
  <li>Out-of-order execution and speculative execution
  <li>Integrated memory controller
  <li>Two-way integer execution
  <li>Two-way 128-bit wide floating-point and packed integer execution
  <li>Integer hardware divider
  <li>Consumer processors support two DDR3L DIMMs in one channel at frequencies up to 1600 MHz[3]
  <li>Server processors support two DDR3 DIMMS in one channel at frequencies up to 1600 MHz with ECC[4]
  <li>As a SoC (not just an APU) it integrates Fusion controller hub
  <li>Jaguar does not feature clustered multi-thread (CMT), meaning that execution resources are not shared between cores

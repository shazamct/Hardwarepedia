      <p>A processor is an integrated electronic circuit that performs the calculations that run a computer. A processor performs arithmetical, logical, input/output (I/O) and other basic instructions that are passed from an operating system (OS). Most other processes are dependent on the operations of a processor.</p>

      <h3><b>Intel vs. AMD</b></h3>

    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Choosing the right CPU (central processing unit) is one of the most important decisions you'll make when building your PC. The processor you choose will ultimately determine which motherboard you can equip your build with, which in turn can affect the compatibility of other components.

So, AMD vs. Intel, which should you go for? Well, that's mostly down to your requirements, but with AMD's recent Zen 2 processors, the AMD vs. Intel decision just got a whole lot harder.

In this piece, we're going to discuss some of the main differences between the two CPU brands and what they bring to the table in an easy-to-understand way.

Cue the Mortal Kombat music, FIGHT!</p>
      <p>For those out there that are struggling to understand this concept, let's try an analogy. If the CPU in this instance was a factory, then having more cores and threads would be like having extra factory workers. This would mean a higher Gigahertz (GHz) would be like having a faster workforce.

It’s worth noting that all of the CPUs we talk about below have varying levels of speed, cores, and threads, meaning they all have specific pros and cons.</p>
      <br><p>As most will know, Intel has always been the dominant force when it comes to overall revenue and stock sales. I mean, until recent history, no one really bothered with AMD processors because the Intel market was so strong in both the performance and price categories.

However, since Ryzen’s new 3rd Gen CPUs hit shelves, that trend might finally be starting to sway in AMD’s favor. Let’s have a look at some figures to see how each company is trending.

These figures are based on the last ten years and do not include the Q3 2019, which is when Ryzen’s 3rd Gen CPUs went live.

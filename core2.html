      <h3><b>Intel Core 2</b></h3>

    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
  <p>Core 2 is a brand encompassing a range of Intel's consumer 64-bit x86-64 single-, dual-, and quad-core microprocessors based on the Core microarchitecture. The single- and dual-core models are single-die, whereas the quad-core models comprise two dies, each containing two cores, packaged in a multi-chip module.[2] The introduction of Core 2 relegated the Pentium brand to the mid-range market, and reunified laptop and desktop CPU lines for marketing purposes under the same product name, which previously had been divided into the Pentium 4, Pentium D, and Pentium M brands.

The Core 2 brand was introduced on July 27, 2006,[3] comprising the Solo (single-core), Duo (dual-core), Quad (quad-core), and in 2007, the Extreme (dual- or quad-core CPUs for enthusiasts) subbrands.[4] Intel Core 2 processors with vPro technology (designed for businesses) include the dual-core and quad-core branches.

<p>Although Woodcrest processors are also based on the Core architecture, they are available under the Xeon brand. Since December 2006, all Core 2 Duo processors are manufactured from 300 millimeter plates at Fab 12 factory in Arizona, USA and at Fab 24-2 in County Kildare, Ireland.

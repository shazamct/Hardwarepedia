    <p>AMD K10 family is the latest generation of AMD x86 microprocessors. The first nine microprocessors from this family, quad-core Third Generation Opterons, were introduced on September 10 2007. 2 months after that AMD released first desktop Phenom quad-core microprocessors, and the first triple-core Phenom X3 CPUs were released in March 2008. At the end of 2008 AMD launched middle-class K10-based processors, that received the same name as high-performance CPUs built on K8 micro-architecture - Athlon X2. In 2009 AMD launched newer generation of middle-class and high-performance desktop processors, branded Athlon II and Phenom II respectively. At this moment (March 2010) K10 families cover three main market segments - desktop, mobile and server, and are divided into three main groups in accordance with processors' price and performance:

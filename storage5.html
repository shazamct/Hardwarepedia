      <h3><b>SATA 3 SSD</b></h3>

    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Stands for "Solid State Drive." An SSD is a type of mass storage device similar to a hard disk drive (HDD). It supports reading and writing data and maintains stored data in a permanent state even without power. Internal SSDs connect to a computer like a hard drive, using standard IDE or SATA connections.</p>
      <p><h3>What is a SATA SSD?</h3>
SATA SSDs look like laptop hard drives, flat and rectangular like the Samsung pictured above. They are the lowest grade SSD and use the same interface as hard drives. However, a PC that uses a SATA SSD has three to four times the bandwidth (how much data it can read/write simultaneously) than a PC using a hard drive. SATA SSDs are also more abundant and cheaper than NVMe-PCIe ones and are still great for common applications.</p>
<p>In general, performance of any particular device can vary significantly in different operating conditions. For example, the number of parallel threads accessing the storage device, the I/O block size, and the amount of free space remaining can all dramatically change the performance (i.e. transfer rates) of the device.

SSD technology has been developing rapidly. Most of the performance measurements used on disk drives with rotating media are also used on SSDs. Performance of flash-based SSDs is difficult to benchmark because of the wide range of possible conditions. In a test performed in 2010 by Xssist, using IOmeter, 4 kB random 70% read/30% write, queue depth 4, the IOPS delivered by the Intel X25-E 64 GB G1 started around 10,000 IOPs, and dropped sharply after 8 minutes to 4,000 IOPS, and continued to decrease gradually for the next 42 minutes. IOPS vary between 3,000 and 4,000 from around 50 minutes onwards for the rest of the 8+ hour test run.</p>
